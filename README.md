# 👋 Hi, I’m Edward — Fullstack Tech Lead & Systems Engineer

I design and build **scalable, reliable, production-grade systems** across healthcare, AI, and enterprise platforms.  
My experience spans fullstack engineering, system architecture, cloud infrastructure, and technical leadership.

I specialize in taking products from **MVP → stable, performant, production-ready platforms** used by thousands.

## 🚀 Core Focus Areas
- Fullstack Architecture (React, Next.js, Python, FastAPI, Node.js)  
- High-Performance Backend Services  
- Scalable Frontend Systems (TypeScript, React)  
- Cloud Infrastructure (GCP, AWS, Azure)  
- AI Integrations (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Deepgram, ElevenLabs)  
- CI/CD, Docker, DevOps Automation  
- Code Quality, Mentorship, Engineering Leadership

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
Great engineering is built on:

- **Modularity** — Clean boundaries, predictable behavior  
- **Reliability** — Resilient systems with observability and fault tolerance  
- **Usability** — UX-first experiences that feel intuitive and responsive  
- **Maintainability** — Clear patterns, documentation, and test coverage  
- **Scalability** — Designed for growth, not future rewrites  

I mentor teams toward craftsmanship and maintain a high engineering bar.
